System requirements
===================
The requirements to run Chatty are very simple:
* a web server which supports PHP as a module (for instance, the most
famous one, Apache - www.apache.org)
* PHP
* MySQL
As far as server load is concerned, it is rather difficult making a
prediction, it depends greatly on `how many users you've got' and
`how many hits you have on your site'. But please remember that
currently the page which shows the `dialogue' is set to be refreshed
every 10 seconds, and thus you will probably need a quite powerful
machine to run it properly.

Installation
============
Installing the software should be very easily, even though there is
no automatic procedure to do that. Just gunzip & un-tar the file you've
got, modify the config.inc.php and connect.inc.php files to suit your
configuration and needs, run the chat.sql MySQL-script and that should
be enough!

These are the steps more detailed:

In order to create the DB you need a MySQL db running. Connect to it in
some way: you might be using phpAdmin, a graphical frontend, or the mysql
command-line console, or other tools.
To connect, you need a user and a password which must have the capability
of creating databases and tables.
If you have them, connect and you just have to copy and paste the contents
of the chat.sql file where your utility allows you to do so.
At this time, you have finished creating your DB, which is named "chatty".
This is the place where everything will be stored (info regarding users, the
chat messages, and so on)

Now, open the connect.inc.php file you unzipped in some folder on the filesystem.
There are 3 lines at the very beginning:

define("HOSTNAME", "localhost");
define("USERNAME", "");
define("PASSWORD", "");

Change them in order to fit your needs. The first (HOSTNAME) should probabily
remain the same.
The second (where USERNAME is defined) should be changed to reflect to the
username you used in point 2. For instance, it might look like:
define("USERNAME", "root");
if "root" was the user you provided to MySQL when you created the Chatty DB.
The same happens with password. Just write the password of the given user.
Be sure to write your username and password in the correct case, and ***inside***
the provided quotes (that is, in our example, "root" and not root if root is the
user)

Then on with config.inc.php
Even if you do not change it, the chat should work. However, you probably want
to customize this, too.
Change the lines:
/* logo URL */
$logo_url = "http://URL_TO_YOUR_LOGO/";

/* host specification */
$your_host = "yourhost.com";
$mail_address = "webmaster@yourhost.com";

by setting the URL of your logo (this will go in a small area in the bottom-left
corner of the screen), your hostname with the full path to the folder of Chatty
(e.g. www.olivo.net/chatty - without the trailing slash) and your email address.

Then, finally, connect to http://YOUR_SITE/chatty/
You should receive a screen asking for login or registration.

NOTE: register_globals *MUST* be on!
